> first one is polynomial function. 

> e is the number with approx. infinite number of decimal places. 
> e is a special number.
>  rate to change for e^x is e^x

> log of x is 1/x which is logarithm.
> be careful of sign at the last one..

## Reminder - Power Rules

1. Any number with power of 0 is 1.
## Product Rule

Where the derivate of 2 can be lead like this where u can solve derivative of first with product of the other and adding to the derivate of other with the product of the first



## Chain Rule

What are you looking for to employ the chain rule?
* Composite functions - that is function within a function. You will be able to idenitify an "inner" and "Outer" function.

## Quotient Rule

What are you looking for to employ the quotient rule?
* x's in both the numerator and denominator.

## Explicit versus Implicit Equations

* Explicit equation - the dependent variable is written explicitly in terms of the independent variable.
* for example: y = 3x + 5
* So far in this topic we have only been dealing with explicit equations.
* Implicit equation - the dependent variable is not isolated on one side of the equation.
* for example : 3x + 5 - y = 0
* In Many cases, it is not possible to rearrange an equation to be in an explicit form.
* for example : 3xy + 5y - y^2 = 0 and sin(xy) + y = 10

To perform explicit differentiation, you need to first rearrange the equation to be in explicit form. however:
* Sometimes this isn't possible 
* Sometimes the rearrangement is difficult or time consuming

Fortunately, we can still differentiate functions written in implicit form using "Implicit differentiation"

Implicit differentiation relies on the application of the chain rule. No rearrangement of the equation is necessary before the derivative is calculated.


## Rates of Change

* Calculating the derivative can also be thought of as calculating the rate of change.
* This is especially appropriate for problems which look at how a variable changes over time.
