## Topic 1 : Introduction to Calculus and Algebra

Brief review of basic differentiation rules, the product rule and the chain rule.

## Some Common functions.

> first one is polynomial function. 

> e is the number with approx. infinite number of decimal places. 
> e is a special number.
>  rate to change for e^x is e^x

> log of x is 1/x which is logarithm.
> be careful of sign at the last one..


## Reminder - Power Rules

1. Any number with power of 0 is 1.
## Product Rule

Where the derivate of 2 can be lead like this where u can solve derivative of first with product of the other and adding to the derivate of other with the product of the first



## Chain Rule

What are you looking for to employ the chain rule?
* Composite functions - that is function within a function. You will be able to idenitify an "inner" and "Outer" function.

## Quotient Rule

What are you looking for to employ the quotient rule?
* x's in both the numerator and denominator.

## Explicit versus Implicit Equations

* Explicit equation - the dependent variable is written explicitly in terms of the independent variable.
* for example: y = 3x + 5
* So far i
