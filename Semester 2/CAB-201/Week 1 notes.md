## Integral Types
> What different types are available ? How much memory do they consume?

### Data
* Data can be constant or variable.
* A constant data does not change.
* A Variable changes.

### Types 

C# has 5 Basic types of Groups.
1. Numeric - Integers or floating point.
2. String - text.
3. Characters - individual Characters.
4. Boolean - True or False.
5. Object - stores data and behaviour.

#### Numeric 
* Integral or Floating point.
* Range ( size ).
* Signed or unsigned.

## Integral Types 

* Whole Numbers numbered types 
	* No decimals 
* Can hold numbers with different ranges and different memory sizes.
* Either positive and negative number or zero
* Good Example of a C# being a statically typed language.

## C# as a Statically Typed Language.
What is a Statically typed language? How does it differ from a dynamic language?

## Statically Type Language

1. A variable's Type must be deleted.
2. The Variable must be declared before its use.
3. A variable can only be declared once.
