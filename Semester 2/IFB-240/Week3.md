## Managing Cyber/Info Security

### Key Questions to Consider

1. **What needs to be protected?**
   - Identify information assets and their criticality.
2. **Why protect these assets?**
   - Determine the importance of protection.
3. **What could go wrong?**
   - Consider potential threats and vulnerabilities.
4. **Consequences and Impact**:
   - Assess potential damage and impact if an event occurs.
5. **Protection Strategies**:
   - Identify how to protect assets, required resources, and associated costs.
6. **Risk Management**:
   - Making trade-offs due to limited resources; some level of risk is inevitable.

### What is Risk?

#### Definitions:

- **Oxford Dictionary**: Exposure to danger, the possibility of something unpleasant happening.
- **Cyber/Info Security**: Defined in AS/NZS 27005:2012 as the "effect of uncertainty on objectives." This includes potential events and their consequences.

#### Risk in Cyber/Info Security:

- **Likelihood**: Chance of an event happening.
- **Consequences**: Outcome affecting objectives, which can be positive or negative.
- **Perception of Magnitude**: Varies by stakeholder perspective (e.g., financial loss impact).

#### Examples of Negative Events:

- Power loss
- Communication system failure
- Data loss or theft
- Confidential information disclosure

### Understanding Threats and Vulnerabilities

- **Threats**: Sources of potential harm (e.g., natural disasters, human actions).
- **Vulnerabilities**: Characteristics that allow threats to manifest (e.g., flaws or weaknesses).

#### Risk Components:

- **Threat Source**: Natural or human actions (accidental or deliberate).
- **Vulnerability**: A characteristic that enables a threat to exploit an asset.
- **Event**: The occurrence of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.

## Risk Management Process

1. **Establish the Context**:
   - **External Context**: Relationship with the external environment.
   - **Internal Context**: Understand the organization’s capabilities and objectives.
   - **Risk Management Context**: Define goals, objectives, and scope of the risk management process.

2. **Risk Assessment**:
   - **Risk Identification**: Determine what can happen, where, and when.
   - **Risk Analysis**: Assess the magnitude of identified risks (qualitative and quantitative).
   - **Risk Evaluation**: Compare risk estimates with criteria and prioritize risks.

3. **Risk Treatment**:
   - **Options**: Avoidance, modification, sharing, or retention.
   - **Implementation**: Prepare and document treatment plans, assess residual risk.

4. **Risk Communication and Consultation**:
   - **Develop a Communication Plan**: For internal and external stakeholders.
   - **Risk Statement**: A concise summary of risks for communication.

5. **Risk Monitoring and Review**:
   - **Ongoing Review**: Monitor identified risks, treatment effectiveness, and emerging risks.
   - **Record Keeping**: Document processes, decisions, and data sources.

### Summary

- **Controlled Process**: Managing cyber/info security involves systematic risk control, not ad-hoc responses.
- **Standards for Best Practice**:
  - AS/NZS 27005:2012: Information Security Risk Management.
  - AS/NZS 27001:2023: ISMS Requirements.
  - AS/NZS 27002:2022: Information Security Controls.

## Managing Information Security

### Key Questions

1. **What needs to be protected?**
   - Identify your information assets, their locations, and their value.
2. **Why do these assets need protection?**
   - Assess potential threats and vulnerabilities that could damage the assets.
3. **How can these assets be protected?**
   - Determine the necessary resources and their costs for protection.
   - Evaluate the urgency of implementing protection measures.
4. **What happens if these assets are not protected?**
   - Consider the potential costs and consequences of inadequate protection.

### Making Trade-offs

- Since resources are limited, prioritize protection based on risk management.
- It’s not possible to protect all assets against all threats; some level of risk is involved.
