Managing Cyber/Info Security
Key Questions to Consider:
What needs to be protected? Identify information assets and their criticality.
Why protect these assets? Determine the importance of protection.
What could go wrong? Consider potential threats and vulnerabilities.
Consequences and Impact: Assess potential damage and impact if an event occurs.
Protection Strategies: Identify how to protect assets, required resources, and associated costs.
Risk Management: Making trade-offs due to limited resources; some level of risk is inevitable.
What is Risk?
Definitions:

Oxford Dictionary: Exposure to danger, the possibility of something unpleasant happening.
Cyber/Info Security: Defined in AS/NZS 27005:2012 as the "effect of uncertainty on objectives." This includes potential events and their consequences.
Risk in Cyber/Info Security:

Likelihood: Chance of an event happening.
Consequences: Outcome affecting objectives, which can be positive or negative.
Perception of Magnitude: Varies by stakeholder perspective (e.g., financial loss impact).
Examples of Negative Events:

Power loss
Communication system failure
Data loss or theft
Confidential information disclosure
Understanding Threats and Vulnerabilities
Threats: Sources of potential harm (e.g., natural disasters, human actions).

Vulnerabilities: Characteristics that allow threats to manifest (e.g., flaws or weaknesses).

Risk Components:

Threat Source: Natural or human actions (accidental or deliberate).
Vulnerability: A characteristic that enables a threat to exploit an asset.
Event: The occurrence of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
Risk Management Process
Establish the Context:

External Context: Relationship with the external environment.
Internal Context: Understand the organization’s capabilities and objectives.
Risk Management Context: Define goals, objectives, and scope of the risk management process.
Risk Assessment:

Risk Identification: Determine what can happen, where, and when.
Risk Analysis: Assess the magnitude of identified risks (qualitative and quantitative).
Risk Evaluation: Compare risk estimates with criteria and prioritize risks.
Risk Treatment:

Options: Avoidance, modification, sharing, or retention.
Implementation: Prepare and document treatment plans, assess residual risk.
Risk Communication and Consultation:

Develop a Communication Plan: For internal and external stakeholders.
Risk Statement: A concise summary of risks for communication.
Risk Monitoring and Review:

Ongoing Review: Monitor identified risks, treatment effectiveness, and emerging risks.
Record Keeping: Document processes, decisions, and data sources.
Summary
Controlled Process: Managing cyber/info security involves systematic risk control, not ad-hoc responses.
Standards for Best Practice:
AS/NZS 27005:2012: Information Security Risk Management.
AS/NZS 27001:2023: ISMS Requirements.
AS/NZS 27002:2022: Information Security Controls.


Managing Information Security
Key Questions
What needs to be protected?

Identify your information assets, their locations, and their value.
Why do these assets need protection?

Assess potential threats and vulnerabilities that could damage the assets.
How can these assets be protected?

Determine the necessary resources and their costs for protection.
Evaluate the urgency of implementing protection measures.
What happens if these assets are not protected?

Consider the potential costs and consequences of inadequate protection.
Making Trade-offs

Since resources are limited, prioritize protection based on risk management.
It’s not possible to protect all assets against all threats; some level of risk is involved.
