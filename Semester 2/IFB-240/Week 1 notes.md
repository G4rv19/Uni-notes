## Cyber Security Notes

### What is Cyber Security?
- **Definition**:
  - *Australian Cyber Security Centre*: Measures to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data.
  - *NIST*: Prevention, protection, and restoration of systems and data to ensure availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation.

### What is Information Security?
- **Definition**:
  - *Australian Cyber Security Centre*: Protection of information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
  - *NIST*: Similar focus on protecting information systems.

### Cyber Security vs. Information Security
- **Information Security**:
  - Focuses on protecting information assets from harm or mitigating risks.
- **Cyber Security**:
  - Focuses on protecting computer systems, networks, and the electronic data they store and transmit.
  - **Cyberspace**: The environment formed by electronic components and networks used to store, transmit, and process data.

### Fundamental Concepts
- **Asset Protection**:
  - Identify and understand the value, location, and criticality of assets.
  - Consider both accidental and intentional harm.
  - Implement protection methods and strategies for prevention, detection, and recovery.

### Assets
- **Types**:
  - **Information Assets**: Data stored in any manner with value.
  - **Property**: Physical assets (buildings, hardware, software, networking components).
  - **People**: Employees, contractors, customers.
  - **Procedures**: Methods for handling data.
  - **Non-tangible Assets**: Reputation.

- **Asset Worth**:
  - Consider acquisition cost, value addition, and criticality.
  - Example: A web server's criticality for an online store or government department.

### Traditional Security Goals
- **Confidentiality**:
  - Ensures information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals, processes, or devices.
- **Integrity**:
  - Ensures data is created, amended, or deleted only by authorized individuals.
- **Availability**:
  - Ensures resources are accessible and usable when required by an authorized user.

### Example Breaches
- **University of Queensland (2015)**: Confidentiality breach.
- **Red Cross Blood Service (2016)**: Integrity breach.
- **Optus Outage (2023)**: Availability breach.

### Additional Security Goals
- **Authentication**:
  - Verifies claimed identity (entity authentication) and the source of a received message (data origin authentication).
- **Non-repudiation**:
  - Creates evidence of actions to prevent users from denying their actions later.

### Example: Authenticity
- Importance of verifying legitimate messages to avoid phishing and protect assets.

### Misconceptions
- **Information Security ≠ IT Security**:
  - Information is handled in many ways, not just in IT systems.
- **Information Security ≠ Confidentiality**:
  - Confidentiality is just one aspect; not all information requires confidentiality (e.g., public websites).

### Summary
- **Security**:
  - Protects assets, especially information.
  - **Cyber Security**: Focus on electronic systems and data.
  - **Traditional Security Goals**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.
  - **Additional Aspects**: Authentication, Non-repudiation.

- **Key Takeaway**:
  - Understanding these fundamentals is crucial, and they will be discussed throughout the course.

### Fundamental Concepts: Threats and Vulnerabilities
- **Threats**: Circumstances with the potential to harm information assets by compromising security goals.
- **Vulnerabilities**: Weaknesses in a system that could be exploited by a threat.

### Example: Personal Laptop
- **Threat**: Theft of laptop.
  - **Impact**: Breach of availability and possibly confidentiality.
- **Vulnerability**: Poor physical security (e.g., unlocked window).

### Example: Workplace - Customer Information
- **Threat**: Unauthorized disclosure of customer information.
- **Vulnerability**: Improper disposal or reuse of storage media.

### Cyber/Info Security Incidents
- **Incident**: When a threat acts on a vulnerability, causing harm.
- **Australian Cyber Security Centre**: An unexpected event compromising business operations.

### Incidents and Attacks
- **Attack**: A security incident where vulnerabilities are deliberately exploited by an attacker (also known as threat actor or adversary).
- Non-deliberate incidents can still cause serious harm.

### Example: QUT Flood (Feb 2022)
- **Threat**: External weather event causing damage.
- **Vulnerability**: Physical location in a flood-prone area.
- **Incident**: Flood causing property damage affecting information assets.

### Information States
- **In Storage**: Stored in electronic, physical, or human containers.
- **In Transmission**: Physical or electronic transfer of information.
- **In Processing (In Use)**: Physical, electronic, manual, or automated processing.

### Fundamental Concepts: Controls
- **Controls (Security Measures/Countermeasures)**: Protect assets by countering threats or reducing vulnerabilities.
  - **Preventive**: Prevent incidents (e.g., encryption, training).
  - **Detective**: Identify attempts or exploited vulnerabilities (e.g., intrusion detection).
  - **Corrective**: Recover from harm (e.g., backups).

### Summary
- **Security**: Protecting information assets from harm.
- **Traditional Goals**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.
- **Incidents**: Result from the intersection of threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Controls**: Implement to achieve security goals. More on this throughout the semester.

### Why Care About Info/Cyber Security?
- **Personal Information**: Includes name, DOB, address, financial/medical details, browsing history, emails, GPS locations, photos, passwords, etc.
  - **Questions to Consider**: Who has this info? Are you okay with them accessing it? Does it depend on certain conditions?

- **Corporate Information**: Includes employee, client, supplier data, financial details, trade secrets, and system configurations.
  - **Security Concerns**: Which information is okay to be accessed by others, and under what circumstances?

### Examples of Cyber Incidents
- **ANU Data Breach**: Reported June 2019.
- **TikTok Access**: Concerns over phone content access, July 2022.
- **Toll Group Cyber Attack**: Ransomware attack, May 2020.
- **Optus Outage**: Impacted 10 million customers, November 2023.
- **Colonial Pipeline Ransomware Attack**: US, May 2021.

### The Importance of Cyber Security
- **Cyber Crime**: Refers to crimes where information technology is the target (e.g., hacking, viruses) or used as a tool (e.g., phishing, identity theft).
  - Growth in internet use increases cyber crime likelihood.

### Example: Cyber Security Problems
- **Ransomware**: Malware encrypting files, demanding payment for decryption.
  - **Example**: WannaCry ransomware, May 2017.
  - **Lion Nathan Cyberattack**: Ransomware disrupted operations, June 2020.
- **Vehicle Remote Control**: Hackers remotely controlled a Jeep Cherokee, demonstrating vulnerabilities in vehicle systems, July 2015.

### Improving Security
- **Identify**: Know your information assets, their location, value, and potential threats.
- **Protect**: Implement controls to prevent, detect, and react to security incidents.
  - **Control Types**:
    - **Technology**: Encryption, firewalls, digital signatures.
    - **Policy/Practice**: Acceptable use policies, data protection policies.
    - **Education/Training**: Employee training on social engineering, password protection.

### Summary
- **Security**: Focuses on protecting information assets from harm.
- **Key Points**:
  - Understand threats, vulnerabilities, and the importance of information security.
  - Implement a combination of preventive, detective, and corrective controls.
